* **GitHub Issue**: https://github.com/nodejs/loaders/issues/117

## Present

* Geoffrey Booth: @geoffreybooth
* Jacob Smith: @jakobjingleheimer
* Gil Tayar: @giltayar
* Maël Nison: @arcanis

## Agenda

Can we unblock the off-thread PR? Does the “subsequent loaders” PR need to wait on it?
* https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/43772
* https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44710

## Notes

Decision: 
* @arcanis will rebase https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/43772, we’ll re-review it, and assuming it’s fine we’ll land it, and it can be released in 19.x. I’ll mark it as blocked from release on 18 and below until the off-thread PR lands or Jan. 1, 2023, whichever comes first, to avoid unnecessary churn for the majority of users.
