## Agenda

* https://github.com/nodejs/loaders/pull/89: Proposal for `preImport` hook

## Notes

Moving loaders off-thread might let us preserve an async `resolve` hook, with an `import.meta.resolve` that will appear to user code to be synchronous (can be called without `await`).

### Plan per today:

* Revert [the PR that changed our loader `resolve` hook and `import.meta.resolve` to become sync](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/43363), with a note that the PR will go back in if we discover that we can’t keep our async `resolve` hook with sync-looking `import.meta.resolve` via moving loaders off-thread. (Or if we discover that we can’t move loaders off-thread after all.)

* Close the [`preImport` PR](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/43245) for now, as we won’t need it if we can preserve the async `resolve`.

* Work on moving loaders off thread. Confirm that we _can_ keep the async `resolve` hook. If we succeed, we’re done and we can move on without reviving the old sync `resolve` and `preImport` PRs.
