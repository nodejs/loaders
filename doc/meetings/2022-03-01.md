## Agenda

### nodejs/loaders

* Add ambient-loader proposal [#63](https://github.com/nodejs/loaders/pull/63)

## Notes

* Maël will address open issues on the ambient loaders PR and land that.

* Maël will address the question of why not make all loaders follow the “ambient loaders” behavior, so that we can avoid two types of loaders. What are the pros and cons. (Could be an issue, PR to the ambient loaders proposal after it lands, whatever.)

* Maël will open an issue discussing reentrancy/”start from beginning.” So instead of only having access to `next` and the next loader in the chain, each loader would also have access to the first loader in the chain, similar to `import.meta.resolve`. The issue should include use cases of when this might be desirable (example in Yarn/PnP?).

* Other examples to investigate:
  * the `esm` package and how it avoids processing dependencies
  * the `pirates` package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/pirates) and how it keeps CommonJS loaders from interfering with each other

* Need to land chaining first, since ambient loaders depends on it; and we need to either land the PR that moves loaders off-thread or at least figure out how moving off-thread will affect ambient loaders. Will loaders be one loader per thread or all loaders in a “loaders” thread? If the former, how would ambient loaders work with that; or perhaps that’s a reason to keep them all in a “loaders” thread.
