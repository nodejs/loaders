The “patch the source” approach is in progress and seems promising, and could be better overall than a “mutate the exports” solution. The patch approach will need to be used for old versions of Node anyway so it might not make much sense to add a new API to enable a mutation alternative, especially if the patch approach can be made more performant (such as by having patched files already available on disk, rather than patching on the fly). Bryan and Ayan will investigate. If a new API is desired, it probably won’t involve any breaking changes to existing APIs and therefore the hooks API should be okay to go stable soon.

The deadlock might be avoidable if we change the first argument of `register` from being any specifier to instead only be a relative or absolute URL. So anyone doing `register(‘foo’)` today would need to change that to `register(import.meta.resolve(‘foo’))`, but we think this might fix the deadlock.
