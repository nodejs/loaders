## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **loaders-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* esm: implement the getFileSystem hook [#41076](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/41076)

### nodejs/loaders

* Loader chaining *while loading loaders* [#56](https://github.com/nodejs/loaders/issues/56)


## Notes

Next steps:
* Maël will write a design doc for filesystem hooks, submit as a PR in the loaders repo.
* Before filesystem looks land, two other PRs need to precede it:
  * Chaining loaders
  * Moving loaders off-thread (or could possibly go after filesystem hooks)
* Maël mentioned Yarn PnP will need the ability to implement other loaders (where yarn will act as a loader of loaders). After discussing concerns raised by Bradley and Jacob around the **significant** logical complexity implications as well as the worker context issues (not all workers will have all the same loaders), we determined the use-case to likely to need merely a higher-tier of loaders rather than special loaders within the same tier; we've dubbed this higher-tier "ambient loaders" (which would have a different CLI flag, ex `--ambient-loader=./godly-loader.mjs --loader=./ts-loader.mjs`, and all ambient loaders would be present in all workers). Leveraging this will however still mean the system is non-deterministic, and thus allowing for high probability of foot-gunning.
  * Maël will write up a proposal doc, including a thorough explanation of the use-case.
