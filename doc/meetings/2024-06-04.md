## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **loaders-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/53332
* https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/53200

Summary: We want to move forward with both of the above PRs.

* https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/53200 needs the `BroadcastChannel` fix so that wherever the _first_ `register` call happens (on the main thread or from a worker thread) there isn’t a hang.
* https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/53332 will be updated to rebase on the above once it’s done, and will also remove any new public APIs around removing/clearing registered hooks.
