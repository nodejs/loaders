## Agenda

* module: unflag import assertions [#40250](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/40250)

## Notes

Discussion over whether assertion should be part of the module cache key or not, and consequences of one way or the other. @GeoffreyBooth will try to implement an approach where the assertions are part of the module _job,_ and checking the assertions will happen at the same time as the URL (key) is compared, effectively making it a combined key while still having one job per key. Open question of what to do when a mismatch is found. Will investigate in the open PR, and can even land with a tentative solution that can change later since JSON modules are still flagged and this is an edge case that should never happen in realistic code (two import statements resolving to the same URL, with different assertions).
