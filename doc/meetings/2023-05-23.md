## Notes

### https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/46826 `registerLoader()`

- Whether to deprecate/remove `--loader` flag. Something we might consider after landing `registerLoader`, to simplify overall API. (Loaders can just tell their users to swap `--loader` for `--import`).

- Align name on `register`, so `import { register } from 'node:module'` for whatâ€™s currently called `registerLoader`, to provide a standard namespace for registering customization hooks for various APIs. For example, in the future:

  ```js
  import { register as moduleRegister } from 'node:module';
  import { register as fsRegister } from 'node:fs';
  ```

- Ensure there is a test-case for missing `--loader` flag (assert error thrown) until the follow-up where we remove that limitation. We should hold the first PR from being released until the follow-up also lands.

- Jacob to handle follow-up (reunite ESMLoader classes) ~next week

### https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/47999 `handle CJS via ESMLoader`

- Isaac to help with test-cases

- Jacob to help after `registerLoader` follow-up
